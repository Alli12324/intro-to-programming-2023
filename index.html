"About"

"A little bit about myself, I am an aspiring web developer based in New Jersey,
that wants to make the web easy to use for everyone. 
For as long as I remember, I've always been so intrigued by the constant changing technology that we use everyday 
to communicate and facilitate our daily tasks. Previously I was studying undergrad to be a physical
Therapist but I decided that I wanted to pursue my interest in technology and programming.
Currently learning Javascript and looking forward to learning many new languages.
